ddrv - discord as infinite cloud storage.
-----------------------------------------
ddrv is a Go application that uses Discord's feature of unlimited file attachments to provide virtually infinite cloud storage.

Highlights
- Theoretically infinite file size and Unlimited storage space.
- Support for multiple protocols, HTTP and FTP.
- Robust frontend that works with numerous clients such as web browsers, Filezilla, RClone, Windows Explorer, Ubuntu (Nautilus), and many more.
