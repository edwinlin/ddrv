DDRV - discord as infinite cloud storage.
-----------------------------------------

ddrv is a simple application to use discord's feature of unlimited file attachments for virtually infinite cloud storage.

HIGHLIGHTS
----------

- Support for multiple protocols, HTTP and FTP.
- Robust frontend that works with numerous clients such as web browsers, Filezilla, RClone, Windows Explorer, Ubuntu (Nautilus), and many more.
- To store file metadata PostgreSQL and Bolt (key/value store in pure Go) data providers are supported.
- HTTP supports partial downloads, so you can use multi-threaded download managers and stream video directly to video players.


NEW IN VERSION 2
----------------

- Moved from using webhooks to bot tokens for uploading attachments.
- Added workaround for discord attachment URL signature.
- Better logging using zerolog logging library instead of standard library.
- Moved app configurations from ".env" to "config.yaml".
- Added new disk based dataprovider, you don't need postgres anymore for simple setup.
- Removed support for webdav as it was broken and too slow while listing directories
